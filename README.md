First let us be clear that there is no such tool called "Selenium".we do not need to install Selenium. All we have to do is to download Selenium jars , Import and configure Selenium Jars into Project.

Since we will be write the selenium scripts using Java so we need to pick up some kind of editor to run our Java Code. For this we can  download some kind of IDE like Eclipse or IntelliJ.
 
Eclipse IDE only works with java support,so first thing first you need to download java.
